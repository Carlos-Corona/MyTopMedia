# MyTopMedia

Welcome to MyTopMedia! This project showcases a set of web pages, backend services, and a database, all seamlessly integrated using Docker and Docker Compose. It demonstrates my knowledge in various areas such as database management, backend development using Node.js, frontend development using React, and containerization with Docker.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two main folders:

1. `MyApp`: This folder contains the React frontend version of MyTopMedia along with the backend implemented in Node.js. The frontend offers an intuitive and user-friendly interface for interacting with the application.

2. `www`: This folder includes the vanilla JavaScript version of MyTopMedia along with the backend implemented in Node.js. It provides an alternative version of the application with a more lightweight and straightforward frontend.
